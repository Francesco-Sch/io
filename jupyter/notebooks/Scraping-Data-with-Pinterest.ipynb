    "The creation and curation of datasets is an important part in the work with AI. Datasets enable AI models to learn certain things. Through the creation of a dataset, you can therefore determine what the AI model should learn.  \n",
    "With the creation and curation of an image dataset, you as a designer are able to train an AI model that matches your visual imagination. That is why the creation and curation of image datasets is so important and interesting.  \n",
    "In the end, you could use the created dataset from this notebook to train or fine tune an AI model. You can read more about this under \"7. How to continue\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinterest is a very powerful visual search engine, which let you search through millions of images. It also enables the user to create a collection of images, which are called 'Boards'.  \n",
    "Pinterest uses clever algorithms to find good visual results for a search term. That makes it perfect to create well curated image datasets.  \n",
    "You can find out more about Pinterest [here.](https://about.pinterest.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect the images from Pinterest, we are using a so called 'Crawler' or 'Scraper'. You can think of it, as a tiny little robot that collects data, in our case images, from a website for us. \n",
    "You just have to give him some instructions, which you are going to do in the progress of this notebook. ;)  \n",
    "You can read more about web scraper [here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-scraping-and-how-to-use-it/)\n",
