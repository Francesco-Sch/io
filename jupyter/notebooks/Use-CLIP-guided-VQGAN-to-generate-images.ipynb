    "\n",

For example, if you want to create a more surrealistic look you can define `surreal` as an attribute. The AI models will then try to generate a more surrealistic look. Some interesting attributes to play with are: \n",

    "- high-resolution\n",

    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to set attributes and weights. But they are a handy tool to have more impact on the creation process of the AI.\n",
