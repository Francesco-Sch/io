Coming from the web notebooks, the next step to become more familiar with AI is the JupyterLab Editor.

The Jupyter Lab editor gives the possibility to edit the pre-built notebooks and to get an insight into the code cells. In the editor, it is still possible to display widgets in a notebook, which guarantee an easy handling of the notebooks. You can read more about the widgets under "4. JupyterLab Widgets".

With the editor, it is now possible to customize the predefined notebooks according to your needs. It is also possible to create your own notebooks. Furthermore, widgets can be added to your own notebook via a code collection simply by drag-and-drop. This makes it possible to quickly create new notebooks for AI models and other use cases via a modular system.

Since JupyterLab in its original form is quite confusing and unwieldy to use, JuypterLab was further developed and customized via an extension. This custom JupyterLab interface is also one part of the framework. This interface highlights certain control elements and hides others. It was generally cleaned up and the interaction elements were simplified.
