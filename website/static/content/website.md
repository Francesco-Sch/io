This website serves as an entry point into working with IO. It first explains the motivation and idea behind the framework. After that, it gives an overview of the individual parts of the framework. The overview explains the individual parts and should make you familiar with them. It also serves as a starting point to launch Jupyter Notebooks in a simple web view.

Jupyter Notebooks are basically interactive documents. They allow the combination of text and code, which can also be executed directly in a linear fashion. Jupyter Notebooks are a medium that is often used in AI work, as the popular Python programming language is supported by the notebooks. Moreover, the combination of executable code and text offers the possibility to capture code in a structured and explanatory way. To introduce designers to this world, the entire framework was built around Jupyter Notebooks.

At the end of the website, you will find a link to a documentation of the framework, which lists technical details of the framework in more depth. This documentation is still under development.

The goal of the website is first to give designers an overview and then to introduce them step by step to working with Jupyter Notebooks and AI.

As the hub of the IO framework, this website will continue to grow and extend to make working with AI more accessible to designers.
