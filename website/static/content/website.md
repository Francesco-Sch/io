This website serves as an entry point into working with IO. It explains the motivation and idea behind the framework and it gives an overview of the individual parts of the framework. The overview explains the individual parts of the framework and should make you familiar with them. The website also serves as a starting point to launch Jupyter Notebooks in a simple web view.

Jupyter Notebooks are basically interactive documents. They allow the combination of text and code, which can also be executed directly in a linear fashion. Jupyter Notebooks are a medium that is often used in AI work, as the popular Python programming language is supported by the notebooks. Moreover, the combination of executable code and text offers the possibility to capture code in a structured and explanatory way. To introduce designers to this world, the entire framework was built around Jupyter Notebooks.

At the end of the website is a section linking to the documentation of the framework, which lists technical details in more depth. This documentation is still under development.

The goal of the website is to give designers an overview and then to introduce them step by step to working with Jupyter Notebooks and AI.

As the hub of the IO framework, this website will continue to grow and extend to make working with AI more accessible to designers.
